        <h1>Ashley Nicole Welker</h1>
        <p>I met my wife in Rexburg, Idaho. We lived in the same apartment
        complex and attended the same congregation for our first 3 years
        at Brigham Young University-Idaho.</p>
        <p>The first year I was friends with her
           roomates and became her friend through them. I thought about asking
           her on a date then but I was not sure if I was worthy to date someone
           like her and did not know if she was even interested in me. Our second
           year she actually asked me on our first date. We went on a double date
           with one of her friends to get frozen yogurt. 
        </p>
        <p>I then asked her on a date and took her country dancing. We then 
           dated for about 2 months. I then regretably broke up with her.
           After about 4 months I moved for a semester to Utah for an internship
           in her home town. After a couple of weeks of being around each other again
           I decided I wanted to date her again. I still sometimes cannot believe she
           took me back.
        </p>
        <p>After about another year of dating I took her to California to visit my
            mission and introduce her to the wonderful people I met there. What she
            did not realize, I was planning to propose to her in California. Gratefully
            she said yes, and we were married 4 months later.
        </p>

        <p>Ashley is the love of my life. She is everything I could ever ask for.
            I count myself lucky every day to call her my wife. In a word she is
            awesome!
