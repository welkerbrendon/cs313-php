        <h1>These are the hobbies of the great Brendon Welker!</h1>
        <h2>FOOTBALL</h2>
        <h3>Minnesota Vikings</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <p id="left">I have been a Minnesota Vikings fan all my life.
                My dad has been a fan all his life. When he was
                young and first started watching football the
                Vikings quarterback was Fran Tarkenton. He is a
                hall of fame quarterback known for his ability to
                scramble for a very long time and still pass the ball.
                I was then raised as a fan by my dad but I became a fan
                myself mostly durring the Randy Moss era of the Vikings.</p>

        <h3>BOISE STATE</h3>
        <div>
            <img class="sized" src="../pictures/boise-state.jpg" id="left">
            <p id="right">I was born in Idaho so naturally I also became a
                Boise State football fan. Most of my time watching college
                football was during the era of Coach Chris Petterson who led
                Boise State to the highest national rankings the shool has 
                ever seen. He was also the coach when Boise State beat 
                Oaklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, the greates football game I have
                ever seen.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>FORD MUSTANG</h3>
        <div class="side-by-side">
            <p id="left">I also love cars, specifically american muscle cars.
                My favorite of all american muscle cars is the Ford Mustang.
                I am currently working to restore the one depicted at the top
                of the page. It is a 1966 Ford Mustang and I am restoring it for
                my wife. My dream car (which I will hopefully build myself someday)
                is a 1968 Ford Mustand with the 427 Single Over Head Camshaft with
                a dual, 4 barrel, high rise intake; tri-y long tube headers; 6 speed,
                manual transmission; Ford, 9 inch, positraction rear end; rack and
                pinion steering; 4 wheel, power assist disc brakes; a 5 point
                racing harness; and the Shelby white with blue racing stripes paint job.</p>
