        <h1>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h1>
        <p>I believe in Jesus Christ. I believe He is the savior of the world.
        I believe He gives me the opportunity to repent and change each
        and every day so I can become a better man. I also believe He has a
        specific set of teaching He wants taught to all and I believe He has
        given us prophets again in order to keep these teachings pure. I believe
        this prophet and these teachings can be found in The Church of Jesus Christ
        of Latter-day Saints. I believe this has affected every part of my life and
        I believe everything good in my life has been a product of this belief.</p>
        <h2>Some of the reasons I have this belief:</h2>
        <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>I was born into a family who attended The Church of Jesus Christ of
        Latter-day Saints. Because of this I was taken to this church with my family
        durring my childhood. Even though I stopped going when I started reaching my
        early teenage years, I never forgot the things which I learned going to the
        services and more importantly, I never forgot the feelings I had when I lived
        those teachings.</p>
        <h3>The Book of Mormon</h3>

        <div class="right">
        <p>Eventually, in my later teenage years, I started attending The Church of
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints again. This lead to some of those feelings
        I had when I was younger returning. I noticed there was a joy which I had
        been missing when I was not living the things taught through the modern
        prophets. Because of this I decided to find for myself if it was simply something
        good or if it was actually all what it claimed to be. I decided to know once and
        for all if The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was really the only
        true and living church on the face of the Earth and the only one authorized by
        God to act in the His name. So I read The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of
        Jesus Christ and prayed to know if it was true and if what it contained was fact
        or fiction. I felt without a doubt it was true.</p>

        <h3>The Great California Ventura Mission</h3>
        <p>After I felt it was all true I felt the need to share that with as many as
        I could. So I served a 2 year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
        Saints. I was assigned to serve in the California Ventura Mission. Those two years
        turned my belief into a conversion. As I taught the principles of the gospel as
        they are revealed to us through a modern prophet and as I dedicated every day for
        two years to this and to living those principles I fell in love with it so much
        I will never again leave it.</p>
